The male Megalodon prowls the rocky southwestern Pacific coastline of Vancouver Island, its ghostly dorsal fin rising and dipping beneath the fog-laced surface.  It glides north toward Port Renfrew, then retreats to the south, its swimming pattern becoming more erratic.
The male is agitated, its last meal creating turmoil within its intestinal tract.
The digestive system of predatory sharks is relatively short.  After food enters the stomach, it travels through the duodenum, the beginning of the small intestine.  Located inside the duodenum is a series of folds, called the spiral valve.  Similar in shape to a corkscrew, the spiral valve rotates within the small intestine like a Slinky, providing additional absorption area for a shark to maximize the nutrients of its meal.  But the shape of the organ serves another purpose, providing the creature with a means of regurgitating items that cannot be properly digested.
Perhaps it is the grizzly's thick furry hide, perhaps it is the animal's heavy musculature, but the Megalodon's last meal is causing severe duress within its digestive system.
The big male thrusts its huge head out of the water.  Jaws snap open in a sudden spasm, and then the Meg regurgitates, vomiting out the undigested remains of the grizzly bear.  So violent and powerful is the act that the creature's stomach actually turns inside out, protruding from its cavernous mouth like a pinkish balloon.
Just as quickly as it happens, the stomach is inhaled back down the Megalodon's gullet, its intestines returning to their normal state.
Exhausted from the effort, the Megalodon rolls onto its side and cruises along the surface with its mouth open, the cool sea soothing its inflamed insides.
